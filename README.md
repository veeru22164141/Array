Largest Element in an Array 

    Given an array arr of size N, the task is to find the largest element in the given array. 

    Example: 

    Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 4}
    Output: 20

    Input : arr[] = {20, 10, 20, 4, 100}
    Output : 100
    int largestElement(int arr[], int n);
        int largestElement2(int arr[], int n);

Second Largest Element in Array

    Given an array of integers, our task is to write a program that efficiently finds the second largest element present in the array. 

    Example:

    Input: arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
    Output: The second largest element is 34.
    Explanation: The largest element of the 
    array is 35 and the second 
    largest element is 34

    Input: arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
    Output: The second largest element is 5.
    Explanation: The largest element of 
    the array is 10 and the second 
    largest element is 5

    Input: arr[] = {10, 10, 10}
    Output: The second largest does not exist.
    Explanation: Largest element of the array 
    is 10 there is no second largest element
    Efficient Solution:

    Approach: Find the second largest element in a single traversal. 
    Below is the complete algorithm for doing this:  

    1) Initialize the first as 0(i.e, index of arr[0] element
    2) Start traversing the array from array[1],
    a) If the current element in array say arr[i] is greater
        than first. Then update first and second as,
        second = first
        first = arr[i]
    b) If the current element is in between first and second,
        then update second to store the value of current variable as
        second = arr[i]
    3) Return the value stored in second.

    int secondLargestElement(int arr[], int n);

Check if an Array is Sorted

    Given an array of size n, write a program to check if it is sorted in ascending order or not. Equal values are allowed in an array and two consecutive equal values are considered sorted.

    Examples: 

    Input : 20 21 45 89 89 90
    Output : Yes

    Input : 20 20 45 89 89 90
    Output : Yes

    Input : 20 20 78 98 99 97
    Output : No

     bool isArraySorted(int arr[], int n);
     bool isArraySorted2(int arr[], int n);

Reverse an Array

    Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string.
    Examples : 
    

    Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
    Output : arr[] = {3, 2, 1}

    Input :  arr[] = {4, 5, 1, 2}
    Output : arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 4}

Remove duplicates from a sorted array

    Given a sorted array, the task is to remove the duplicate elements from the array.

    Examples: 

    Input  : arr[] = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
    Output : arr[] = {2}
            new size = 1

    Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5}
    Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            new size = 5
        int removeDuplicates(int arr[], int n);
        int removeDuplicates2(int arr[], int n);

Move Zeros to End

    Given an array of n numbers. The problem is to move all the 0â€™s to the end of the array while maintaining the order of the other elements. Only single traversal of the array is required.
    Examples: 
    

    Input : arr[]  = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6}
    Output : 1 2 3 6 0 0 0

    Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0, 9}
    Output: 1 9 8 4 2 7 6 9 0 0 0 0 0
    void Array::moveZeroesToEnd(int arr[], int n)
Left Rotate an Array by D places

    Given an array of integers arr[] of size N and an integer, the task is to rotate the array elements to the left by d positions.

    Examples:  

    Input: 
    arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, d = 2
    Output: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2

    Input: arr[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2}, d=2
    Output: 5 6 7 1 2 3 4

    void leftRotationByOne(int arr[], int n);
    void leftRotationByD(int arr[], int n, int d);
    void leftRotationByD2(int arr[], int n, int d);
    void leftRotationByD3(int arr[], int n, int d);

Leaders in an Array problem

    Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. 

    For example:

    Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, 
    Output: 17, 5, 2

    Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2}, 
    Output: 5, 2

    void leadersInArray(int arr[], int n);
    void leadersInArray2(int arr[], int n);

Maximum Difference Problem with Order

    Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the maximum difference between any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number. 

    Examples : 

    Input : arr = {2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1}
    Output : 8
    Explanation : The maximum difference is between 10 and 2.

    Input : arr = {7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2}
    Output : 2
    Explanation : The maximum difference is between 9 and 7.
